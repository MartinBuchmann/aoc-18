* My solutions so far

Although I have limited time only I started to solve some [[https://adventofcode.com][AOC]] puzzles. This is
the repository of my CL solutions as far as I get.  

Furthermore I want to try some CL libraries like [[https://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/][alexandria]], [[https://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/][iterate]], [[https://github.com/m2ym/cl-annot][cl-annot]],
[[https://github.com/nightfly19/cl-arrows][cl-arrows]], [[https://edicl.github.io/cl-ppcre/][cl-ppcre]], [[https://www.cliki.net/SPLIT-SEQUENCE][split-sequence]] or [[https://common-lisp.net/project/anaphora/][anaphora]]. I use [[https://www.cliki.net/lisp-unit][lisp-unit]] for testing but
not very persistent.

I must confess that I found inspiration in other repositories like [[https://gitlab.com/asciiphil/advent-of-code/tree/master/2018][Phil! Gold's]]
or [[https://github.com/ntrocado/aoc2018][Nuno Trocado's]] when I was stuck searching for a solution.

Clone the repository to a directory and then run the following commands inside
your REPL to run the first puzzle.
#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
(asdf:make :aoc18)
(in-package :aoc-18)
(aoc-18-01a)
#+END_SRC
